## Time series Forecasting with Machine Learning

"This is part of my research work at Orange. I used libraries for feature extraction such as tsfresh, Catch22, ROCKET, and TSFEL to forecast time series of multiple frequencies as a supervised machine learning task. During the process, I provided insights into the dependency between lags, the most effective libraries and features, and suitable prediction methods.

## Surf Dashboard: Real-Time Sea Conditions for Surfers

This project extracts real-time surf data from Surf-Report using Python web scraping techniques and visualizes the ideal surf conditions through an interactive dashboard built with R (Flexdashboard). It provides:

Live wave & wind data for a chosen location
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like best surf time, highest wave of the week, and a surf quality rating
User-friendly insights to help surfers optimize their sessions
Tech stack: Python (BeautifulSoup, Pandas), R (Flexdashboard), Web Scraping, Data Visualization

Let me know if you want to tweak anything!
