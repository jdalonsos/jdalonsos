## Time series Forecasting with Machine Learning

This is part of my research work at Orange. I used libraries for feature extraction such as tsfresh, Catch22, ROCKET, and TSFEL to forecast time series of multiple frequencies as a supervised machine learning task. During the process, I provided insights into the dependency between lags, the most effective libraries and features, and suitable prediction methods.

## Interpretable Machine Learning

In this notebook, we explore interpretability methods applied to a regression task on electric vehicle specifications. Using a dataset containing technical and performance attributes of electric cars, I aim to understand how different featuresâ€”such as acceleration, top speed, and battery capacityâ€”influence the predicted price of an electric vehicle. I employ both global and local interpretability techniques. Specifically, I use:  SHAP values, Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE), and Accumulated Local Effects (ALE), to shed light on the decision-making process of machine learning models such as Random Forest. 

## Surf Dashboard: Real-Time Sea Conditions for Surfers

This project extracts real-time surf data from Surf-Report using Python web scraping techniques and visualizes the ideal surf conditions through an interactive dashboard built with R (Flexdashboard). It provides:

Live wave & wind data for a chosen location
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like best surf time, highest wave of the week, and a surf quality rating
User-friendly insights to help surfers optimize their sessions
Tech stack: Python (BeautifulSoup, Pandas), R (Flexdashboard), Web Scraping, Data Visualization

Let me know if you want to tweak anything!
